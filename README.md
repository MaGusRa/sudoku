# sudoku

This is a repo for me (and anyone who wants to help) to figure out some backtracking for sudoku generation.
This is just a console app to get going but soon it will be a fully fledged app to rival the NY Times one! I am just obsessed with sudoku and specifically
the one from the Times because it has the best UI of all the others I have seen.
